## Thread Functionalities:

- **Creating Threads:** Registered users can create new discussion threads on various educational topics. Threads typically include a title, description.

- **Posting Comments:** Users can participate in existing discussions by posting comments on threads. This enables interactive and dynamic conversations within each thread. Users are also able to reply to other comments that have been sent
